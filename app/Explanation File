- The code is for an Android flashlight app.
- It extends `AppCompatActivity`, indicating it's an Android activity.
- The layout of the activity is set to `activity_main.xml`.

Inside `onCreate` method:
- Initializes UI elements:
  - `switching`: A ToggleButton used to turn the flashlight on and off.
  - `bulboning` and `bulboffing`: ImageViews representing the state of the flashlight (bulb on and off).

- Sets an `OnClickListener` for the `switching` ToggleButton:
  - When the ToggleButton is clicked:
    - Checks the current text of the button:
      - If it reads "Turn ON," it means the flashlight is currently off.
      - If it's not "Turn ON," the flashlight is currently on.
    - Displays a Toast message to inform the user of the current state ("Bulb now on" or "Bulb now off").
    - Updates the visibility of the `bulboning` ImageView accordingly (visible when the flashlight is on, invisible when off).
    - Calls the `changeLightState` method to control the flashlight state (turn on or off).

- `changeLightState` method:
  - Manages the state of the flashlight:
    - Uses the `CameraManager` to interact with the device's camera.
    - Attempts to get the camera ID (usually the rear camera).
    - Sets the torch mode (flashlight) to the specified state (on or off).
    - Handles potential exceptions with `CameraAccessException`.

- `showToast` method:
  - Displays a Toast message with the specified message and duration (`Toast.LENGTH_SHORT`).

In summary, the code initializes a flashlight app with a ToggleButton to control the flashlight
state and ImageView elements to visually represent the bulb's on/off status. When the ToggleButton is clicked,
it updates the UI, shows a Toast message, and controls the flashlight state using the `CameraManager`.
